 Problem Description:

 In this assignment,you will need to do the same thing as what you have done in assignment 1(Lexical Analyzer) using iFlex.But here it will scan a input.c file containing
 code of valid.c programming and distinct the token.Similar to assignment 1,you will identify all the numerical values,identifiers,keywords,math operators,logical 
 operators and others (distinct).See the example for more details.In this assignment,there may have a space or not after each keyword or token,You will need to write 
 in fact you may write a lex file in iFlex that will do this work.Basically, we have seen these in class about the working procedure of iFlex.For simplicity, we will consider 
 only simple set of instructions.Also you will need tor scan the input.c file sequentially and output the things sequentially.You will demonstrate the code personally 
 to show me i.e. everybody of the group numbers must know how to compile and run the lex file using iFlex.See the following.\

Keyword: int,float,double,if,else,for,return [we will consider 'include' and 'stdio.h' as exceptional keywords].
Function: main,printf,scanf
Identifier: letter(letter_digit)*
Strings: Everything sorrounded by double qoute ["  "].
Numeric values : 25,25.25
Math operators : +,-,*,/,=,++,--
Logical Operators: >,<,>=,<=,==
Brackets : (,{,},)
Others : seek only once [if more than once,print only once]

Hints : Read the manual pdf file or jFlex carefully and explore java.lex file in "examples\java\" directory .



Example: input.c file will look like the following:

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int ab1,ac;
    double d = 5.5;
    ab1 = 3;
    ac = 2;
    if(ab1>ac)
    {
        d = d+10.4;
    }
    else
    {
        d=d+2.5;
    }
    printf("Value of d = %f",d);
    return 0;
}


Output:

Keywords: include,stdio.h,int,int,double,if,else,return
Fuctions:main,printf
identifiers:ab1,ac,d
Strings: "Values of d= %f"
Numeric values : 5.5,2.5,3.2,10.4,2.5,0
Math operators : =,=,=,=,+,=,-
Logical Operators: <,>,>
Brackets : (,),{,(,),{,},{,},}
Others : # , . , :   .
